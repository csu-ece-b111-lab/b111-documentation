# 3D Printer Maintence Documentation

## Upgrading Firmware

The firmware of the internal controllers of the 3D printers should be upgraded
at the begining of each semester, as well as when upgrading to a new Cura
version or implementing major changes to the printers such as upgrading the
extruder heads.
